## What is GraphQL
GraphQL is the new trend and best alternative to Rest-based architecture that pulls all relevant data from multiple sites with a single request. It improves client-server interactions and reduces the latency that makes the app much more responsive to the user.

GraphQL is used to Send a query to Centra API and get exactly what you need, nothing more and nothing less. GraphQL queries always return predictable results. Apps using GraphQL are fast and stable because they control the data they get, not the server.

## Requirements
Live centra
Authentication token
Correct permissions
